# üî• A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) Characters API üêâ

### üîé Overview

Despite the universally acknowledged travesty that was Season 8 of Home Box Office's Game of Thrones, beloved characters from the once-acclaimed franchise remain firmly fixed in the hearts and minds of Westeros enthusiasts. Rewatching the show may still be a bitter pill to swallow, but author George RR Martin still plans on releasing two more installments in its foundational series, _A Song of Ice and Fire_ (hereafter referred to "ASOIAF").

This REST API is a tool for storing and referencing data on ASOIAF's sprawling cast of characters. It was built using JavaScript, Node, Express, and Test-Driven Development.

### üîé Endpoints

Currently, this API has one resource: **Profiles**, with each Profile containing data on a single character from ASOIAF.
