### Definitely Wanna Have Done by Next Week
1. Testing (from Non-Fxnl)
1. Nested route or resource
1. Db persistence layer
1. Look @ Auth + think about how I wanna implement it (_look at Reddit_)

### Functional Requirements
1. Nested route or resource
1. A database persistence layer -- don't need to migrate all existing data; simply set it up such that if we create a new entry (via API calls), it should persist in the db
1. Authentication/authorization
1. Documentation explaining how to use API
1. Simple, static single page brochure site explaining what the API does and a link to the docs

### Non-functional Requirements
1. Fully documented
1. TDD approach
1. Airbnb
1. <b>LAST PRIORITY</b> Deployment -- <i>less important</i>
